SimpleFactorize:
Will test if an unsigned int number with value between 0 and 4294967295 (0xFFFFFFFF) is prime,
inside main.c the function unsigned int IsPrime(unsigned int n)
which will return 0 if number is not prime, 1 if number is prime.
The original project was coded in PellesC, altrough you can use VisualStudio.
